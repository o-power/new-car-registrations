# New Private Car Registrations in Ireland
This project is a single-page website containing an interactive data dashboard. The dashboard explores new private car registrations in Ireland from 2008 to 2018.

Topics explored include: (1) new car sales vs used imports, (2) the popularity ranking of car makes, (3) the composition of new car sales by car model, (4) the popularity ranking of car colours, (5) the number of new car sales in each county per head of population.

## Demo
The deployed site can be found [here](https://o-power.github.io/new-car-registrations/) on GitHub Pages.

## UX
### Wireframes
Desktop wireframes can be found in the wireframes folder.

Mobile wireframes are not included as per the project requirements: "Please note that if you are building a data dashboard, only your chart containers are expected to be responsive. Charts using D3.js are not responsive as they are designed for desktop or large-screen viewing."

### User Stories
* I want to understand the trend in total new car registrations in Ireland.
* I want to understand which car makes have increased/decreased in popularity.
* I want to understand which car models make up the most new car sales.
* I want to understand which car colours have increased/decreased in popularity.
* I want to understand which counties buy the most new cars per head of population.

## Technologies/Libraries
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to manage the layout of the site.
5. [D3](https://d3js.org/) was used to build the charts. DC.js and Crossfilter.js were not used as it was easier to find examples for the chart types needed (treemap, bump chart, map) in D3.js.
6. [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) was used to map the counties of Ireland. It has a smaller file size than GeoJSON.
7. [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used for source control and deployment.
8. [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) was used as the development environment for the project.
9. [Alteryx Designer](https://www.alteryx.com/) was used to prepare the data. Alteryx Designer is a drag-and-drop tool for rapid data preparation.
10. [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org) was used to reduce the file size of the car logos for the bump chart.

## Features
### Existing
### Future
* The functions which build the charts could be made more generic and so reusable.

* The charts could be made responsive by using the [viewBox attribute](https://medium.com/@louisemoxy/a-simple-way-to-make-d3-js-charts-svgs-responsive-7afb04bc2e4b).

## Data Preparation
Data for each year was downloaded separately from [beepbeep.ie](https://stats.beepbeep.ie/). Alteryx Designer was used to combine and clean the data. For the car colours data the multi-coloured category was substituted for any colour category containing the word "and".

The treemap required the data to be in a JSON format with the necessary hierarchial structure. Alteryx Designer was used to build this hierarchy and to convert the data from CSV to JSON.

## Testing
The HTML was checked using the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The CSS was checked using the W3C CSS Validation Service.

The website was tested during development on different screen sizes and devices using Chrome DevTools. The website was also tested on a Samsung A5, a 15 inch laptop and a widescreen monitor.

JavaScript Validation Service.

Different browsers.

All the links were checked to ensure they were working.

Bugs and fixes.

Was not required to be responsive.
### User Story Testing
* _I want to understand the trend in total new car registrations in Ireland._
  The stacked area chart shows the trend in total new car registrations in Ireland. It also shows how the downward trend in recent years may be attributed to the increase in used car imports.
* _I want to understand which car makes have increased/decreased in popularity._
  The bump chart with the car logos shows how the ranking of the different car makes has changed. It easily allows the user to compare the time evolution of a relatively large number of categories (the top 10 car makes).
* _I want to understand which car models make up the most new car sales._
  The treemap shows new car sales by every make and model. Although overwhelming at first, it has the advantage of not hiding any information. The user can explore the details using the tooltips.
* _I want to understand which car colours have increased/decreased in popularity._
  The bump chart with the car colours shows how the ranking of the different car colours has changed. Again, it easily allows the user to compare the time evolution of a relatively large number of categories (16 colours).
* _I want to understand which counties buy the most new cars per head of population._
  The map shows the number of new car sales per 100 adults in each county.

## Deployment
The project was developed on AWS Cloud9. A repository was created on GitHub and regular commits were made.

The project was then deployed using GitHub pages. It is deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To deploy the project on GitHub pages, the following steps were followed.
1. Log into Github
2. Select the repository o-power/new-car-registrations.
3. Select the Settings tab.
4. Scroll down to the section called GitHub Pages.
5. Under Source, select master branch from the dropdown.
6. The page will refresh and a message will appear in the GitHub Pages section saying "Your site is published at https://o-power.github.io/new-car-registrations/".
7. It may take several minutes before the deployed site is ready to be viewed.

To run locally, clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/o-power/new-car-registrations.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
