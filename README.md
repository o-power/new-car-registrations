## Data Preparation
Data for each year was downloaded separately from https://stats.beepbeep.ie/.
Alteryx Designer was used to combine the data for different years.
The treemap required the data to be in a JSON format and Alteryx Designer was used to convert the data from CSV to JSON with the necessary hierarchial structure.

## Testing
The HTML was checked using the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The CSS was checked using the W3C CSS Validation Service.

The website was tested during development on different screen sizes and devices using Chrome DevTools. The website was also tested on a Samsung A5, a 15 inch laptop and a widescreen monitor.

JavaScript Validation Service.

Different browsers.

All the links were checked to ensure they were working.

Bugs and fixes.

## Deployment
The site is hosted using GitHub pages and is deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
