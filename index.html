		        <h2>The switch to used imports</h2>
		        <p>
		        New car sales dropped sharply in 2009 as a result of the banking crisis.
		        Post-2009 new car sales gradually rose, approaching their pre-2009
		        levels in 2016.
		        However, new car sales dropped in 2017 and again in 2018 as the popularity
		        of used imports increased.

		        <h2>The Decline of Gold and Beige</h2>
		        <p>
		        Gold and Beige were the 6th and 8th most popular car colours in 2010 with sales of 4,279 and 1,072 units,
				respectively. In 2018, however, no gold cars were registered and only 1 beige car was registered.
				In contrast, white has risen to the 3rd most popular colour with sales of 18,268 in 2018, up from 1,839 in 2010.
				Grey is the most popular car colour. Multi-coloured cars (i.e. cars with two or more colours like white and 
				black) have seen a rise in popularity although this may be a consequence of more exact reporting of car colours.
				Similarly, silver/aluminium has tumbled in popularity but this may be a consequence of the colour being now reported as grey.
